# Check-ins

Notes to Oliver, newest first.

## Slice 1 — The coast (15 Oct)

The game now opens on a sunny stretch of Greek coast you can fly around, with a clock you can pause and speed up. You weren't here while it was built: every choice below is mine, from the spec's defaults.

### What's new
- A hand-shaped coast in warm low-poly 3D: a curved bay with a small rocky islet, a headland with stone pines to the east, a river that springs from a rocky gorge in the hills and winds down a green, fertile plain to the sea, olive groves planted in loose rows, scrub and yellow broom on the dry golden slopes, cypresses, reeds along the river, and drifts of poppies and daisies.
- Water that moves: gentle waves rolling with the breeze, foam breathing on the beaches, the sun twinkling on the sea, the river flowing with streaks of light and melting into the bay at its mouth.
- Warm afternoon light with soft shadows, a hazy horizon, and the coast and hills carrying on beyond the edge of the land you'll build on.
- A camera you can swing from a view of the whole coast down to standing among the olive trees.
- The calendar: the city's year starts in March 750 BC and counts down, with pause, normal, fast and fastest. At normal speed a month takes about 30 seconds.

### What to try
1. Open `?demo=coast`. Drag with the left mouse button to move across the land, drag with the right button to turn and tilt, scroll to zoom. Press Q and E to turn a quarter at a time, N (or the compass) to face north, and "?" for all the controls.
2. Open `?cam=river` to start at street level on the river bank, looking upstream to the hills. Zoom all the way out from there.
3. Open `?cam=street` to stand among the olive trees west of the bay.
4. Open `?cam=bay` and turn until you face the sun to see the sea glitter.
5. In any view, press Space to pause, then 1, 2 and 3 for normal, fast and fastest, and watch the month and the dots for the days.
6. Also there: `?cam=hills` (where the river rises), `?cam=headland`, `?cam=mouth` (where the river meets the sea) and `?cam=overview` (the whole map from high up).

### What I'd like your eye on
- The overall look: is this the warm, toy-like Greece you had in mind? I tuned colours, light, terrain and water over many rounds of screenshots, but whether it's lovely is your call.
- The colours of the land: I made the slopes dry and golden and kept bright green for the river plain (where farms will go). Too dry, too green, or too patchy?
- The water: the twinkling glints on the sea and the white foam lines on the beaches. Too busy, or not enough?
- The camera: how zooming in lowers the view towards street level, how fast it pans and turns, and whether left-drag to move feels right.
- The calendar: years counting down from 750 BC, with ordinary month names. Would you rather have Greek month names, or a plain "Year 1"?
- The opening view: is that the right first look at the coast?

### Known rough edges
- At very close zoom the river's edges are jagged, drawn as a pebbly margin; the land is shaped in one-tile steps and the stream is only a few tiles wide.
- The far scenery beyond the coast is simple and only meant to be seen through the haze; looking straight along the coast from very far out shows long, plain slopes.
- There's nothing to build yet, and no population or money in the top bar; those come with streets and settlers next.
- No sound yet.
- I couldn't measure the frame rate: I can only run the game with software graphics here, which tells us nothing about your laptop. It would help to hear whether it runs smoothly for you, and on what machine.

### Measurements
- Before: nothing existed.
- Download: 151 KB compressed (three files).
- Load: about 2.5 seconds to the first picture on my machine using software graphics, of which shaping the coast takes about a third of a second; on a real graphics card it should be quicker. The target is under 3 seconds.
- Drawing: about 530,000 triangles in 21 batches each frame, the same in every view. That should sit well within a laptop graphics chip's reach, but the town will need room too, so I've noted ways to trim it before the town grows.
- Frame rate: not measured (see above). The target is 60 frames a second on a mid-range laptop with a few hundred buildings, which can only be judged once the town exists.
